        <p>Hi, I'm Abbey Hart!</p>
        <p>
          {' '}
          I graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in French and
          Francophone studies and moved to Austin, TX from Gainesville, Fl in
          2015. Coincidentally, I began to learn to code. It felt a bit like a
          fish learning how to climp a tree but I started to love the challening
          discomfort that came with coding. Over time, I realized that web
          development was what I wanted to do for my career and I decided to go
          back to school to learn the fundamentals of computer programming and
          become a better web developer.

          I have been programming as a hobby for about two years now and I am in
          school at Austin Community College pursuing my AD in Computer Science.
          Throughout this process, I've met a community that is deeply in love
          with what they do and one that inspires me everyday to learn more
          about the ever expanding field of web development. I've dabbled in
          many languages, frameworks, and libraries, finding my great loves in
          Node.js, Go, Javascript, Graphql, and React.
