## About the project:

The solution to the common problem: whose going to take out the garbage? And other similar questions. Keep up is a website where users can create and share a home, schedule and assign tasks on a rotational basis, and track their weekly progress. As victims of the typical who does what fight, Keep Up has been a labor of love for my boyfriend and I. We are creating Keep Up using Go, Javascript, React, Postgresql, Graphql, and Apollo.
