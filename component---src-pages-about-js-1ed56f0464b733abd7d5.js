I had never thought about programming or web development before but every one I met in Austin seemed to know how to code and I wanted to see what the big fuss was. I've always been an art and history kind of person, so learning to code felt like teaching a fish how to climb a tree. With time, I started to love the challenging discomfort that came with every new problem. Recently, I realized that web development was what I wanted to do for my career and I decided to go back to school to learn the fundamentals of computer programming and become a better web developer."),n.a.createElement("p",{className:"AboutMe__p"},"I have been programming as a hobby for about two years now and I am in school at Austin Community College pursuing my AS in Computer Science. Throughout this process, I've met a community that is deeply in love with what they do and one that inspires me everyday to learn more about the ever expanding field of web development. I've dabbled in many languages, frameworks, and libraries, finding my great loves in Node.js, Go, Javascript, Graphql, and React.")))))}}}]);
