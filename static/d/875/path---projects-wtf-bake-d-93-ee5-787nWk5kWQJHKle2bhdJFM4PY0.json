I love to bake but sometimes I need inspiration for what I should bake. This site solves that problem! Made in Node.js and styled with Sass, this site runs through a list of random baked goods with their recipe site attached.</p>\n<p>I used the following technologies to create WTF Bake:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Express</li>\n<li>Node.js</li>\n<li>Pug templating</li>\n<li>Sass</li>\n<li>Now</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"post__images\">\n  <img class=\"post__image\" src=\"/portfolio/images/homeView.png\">\n  <img class=\"post__image\" src=\"/portfolio/images/recipeView.png\">\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://wtf-bake-buuauiwmmd.now.sh/\">Project</a></p>\n<p>Project on <a href=\"https://github.com/abbeyhrt/wtf-bake\">Github</a></p>\n<p>I started WTF Bake after finishing Wes Bos’ Learn Node course because I wanted to apply what I learned to my own website. While building WTF Bake, I did use only what was taught in Wes Bos’ course but if I remade it today, I would use Gatsby.js instead of Pug. Gatsby offers the same simple templating that Pug offers and uses markdown instead of its own defined schema. Markdown in general is handy to know and I would always prefer to improve a skill that can be used in many places rather than a specific schema for one piece of technology.</p>\n<p>WTF Bake is deployed using Now and while Now makes it easy to deploy any website using the command line tools, Gatsby has a built in deployment with Now that is simpler to use and quicker to learn because of how good Gatsby’s documentation is.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"WTF Bake","description":"Do you have a hankering for sweets but aren't sure what you want to make?
