As victims of the typical who does what fight, Keep Up has been a labor of love for my boyfriend and I. We are creating Keep Up using Go, Javascript, React, Postgresql, Graphql, and Apollo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://keepup.company\">Project</a></p>\n<p>Project on <a href=\"https://github.com/abbeyhrt/keep-up\">Github</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Keep Up","description":"Some description about the project here","date":null},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/projects/keep-up/"}}
